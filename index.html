            <p>Hello, my name is Giselle! I was born and raised in New York City. I am half Colombian and speak fluent
                Spanish. I hold a B.A. in Mass Communication with a minor in Interactive Media from the University of
                Delaware. I currently work on the digital team at an advertising agency, and have previously worked
                freelance as a front-end web developer. I have also worked as a graphic designer in London for Tibet
                Foundation, a
                registered non-political charity working for and with the Tibetan people, both inside Tibet and across
                the Tibetan diaspora.</p>
            <p>I have lived, and worked, on three continents. My hobbies and interests include cycling, hiking,
                traveling, reading and listening to live music. I ride a Specialized Dolce Sport and sincerely look forward to
                never owning a car. My favorite food is cherimoya, also known as custard apple.</p>
